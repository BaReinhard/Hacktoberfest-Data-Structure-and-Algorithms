//Diameter of a tree
## ELI5
The diameter of a tree is its width.The maximum possible number of items between any two end-most items in a tree.

## Explaination
The diameter of a tree (sometimes called the width) is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree.

The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:

* the diameter of T’s left subtree
* the diameter of T’s right subtree
* the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T (this can be computed from the heights of the subtrees of T)
