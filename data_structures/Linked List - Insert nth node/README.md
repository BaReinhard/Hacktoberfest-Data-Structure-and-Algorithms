Insert given data at given position in Linked list 

Algorithm : 
1] If Head is null and position is not 0. Then exit it.
2] If Head is null and position is 0. Then insert new Node to the Head and exit it.
3] If Head is not null and position is 0. Then the Head reference set to the new Node. Finally, new Node set to the Head and exit it.
4] If not, iterate until finding the Nth position or end.
